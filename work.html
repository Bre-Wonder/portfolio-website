                        Wondering what an application for different events could look like? That is what you will find with project. I used a Google API to share events going on in different cities around the world. 
                        The application was built in React as a single page application. I used several different testing libraries to test my code in several different ways through TDD, BDD, and end to end testing methods. 
                        Lastly, I used recharts to created responsive charts that map out the number of events in different cites and show percentages of class types. 

                        Dpendancies used for this project: React, Jest, Jest-Cucumber, Puppeteer, and Recharts.
